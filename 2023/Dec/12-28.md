Dev Log

Dev Goal: Finish job listing function upon login.

this requires:
1. upon login: send request to fetch all the jobs owned by the user email
2. render jobs in a table with clothes image as a Thumbnail.

this should not require any interactions with Runpod. since mongodb is the only source of truth.
